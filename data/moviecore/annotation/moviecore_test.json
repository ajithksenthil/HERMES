        "answer": "Nocturnal hunting for lions involves significant energetic costs, including long hours of stalking and high-speed chases that expend considerable energy. However, the nutritional gains from a successful hunt, which provides essential nourishment and sustenance, justify these efforts. This cost-benefit balance influences their hunting strategies, as lions often target prey that offers a substantial nutritional return relative to the energy spent. Consequently, lions may choose to hunt larger prey less frequently to ensure that the energy expenditure is worthwhile, but they are also opportunistic and will not ignore easier, smaller prey when available.",
